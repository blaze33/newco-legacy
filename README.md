# NewCo Legacy

NewCo was a startup project I worked on between 2012 and 2103.  
The goal was to provide a place where consumers would share informations about the products they used and loved.

While the technical aspects of building a website did materialize, and open-sourced,
the financial aspects never did leading me to work on new projects you can follow on [openbloc.fr](http://openbloc.fr)

[The site is still online](http://newco-prod.herokuapp.com/) as a testimony of what was tried to make an impact at that time.
It's part of my portfolio and it could maybe be reused (don't do this, the tech is too old ;) )
or serve to inspire other projects.

# Deploy your own fork

Nothing's nicer than working code you can actually play with. Once I'll have managed to upgrade my heroku app
to cedar-14 I'll, hopefully, lay out the steps required to deploy your own version :)

# Advice to future entrepreneurs

1. Technology matters as long as it doesn't get in the way of all the rest.
2. Design, UX, marketing, communication matters a lot ! Don't call yourself NewCo,
   as in New Company, really ;)
3. People don't read, much less contribute on the Internet. You can't build your success
   on asking them to do stuff for you. Build it around what they would naturally do with
   the right tool (and build that one).
4. Choose your co-founders wisely. If your co-founder show up one day with another associate
   without having consulted you first, run ! Trust is everything.
5. Making money is a necessary evil, I've got a rent to pay, food to buy. The sooner you can break even, the better.

Have fun !
